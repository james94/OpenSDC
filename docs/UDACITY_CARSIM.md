# Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulators Notes

## Car Simulator for Behavioral Cloning

1\. For collecting data to later train a DL model and deploying DL model into the SDC simulator, we downloaded

- Udacity's **Term 1: Version 1, 12/09/2016** Unity simulator for **Linux** under ***Available Game Builds (Precompiled builds of the simulator)***: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/tree/Unity_2020_3

2\. Here are some steps that I did to run **Term 1: Version 1, 12/09/2016** Unity simulator:

~~~bash
# Downloaded Linux Unity Simulator: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f0f7_simulator-linux/simulator-linux.zip

cd ~/Downloads/

mkdir simulator_linux_ver1_12_09_16

mv simulator-linux.zip simulator_linux_ver1_12_09_16

cd simulator_linux_ver1_12_09_16

unzip simulator-linux.zip
~~~

3\. Double click on `Default Linux desktop Universal.x86_64` to launch the car simulator for behavioral cloning.

- **ALERT**: Udacity's **Term 1: Version 2, 2/07/2017** Unity simulator for **Linux** DOESNT WORK, (which is under ***Available Game Builds (Precompiled builds of the simulator)***), so we'll ignore it.
